(** Forwarding Decision Diagrams

  FDD's are an extension of Binary Decision Diagrams (BDD's).  NetKAT predicates,
  which are mostly based on OpenFlow matches, are just binary formulas after all.
  An FDD extends a BDD by (1) using OpenFlow actions at the leaves instead of binary
  values True and False (2) using complete header matches instead of individual bit
  matches.

  As in BDD's, field ordering is important to prevent combinatorial explosions.
  Fortunately we can exploit what goes in real FDD's to get decent
  heuristics.  Nevertheless, the field ordering is part of the data structure and
  can also be set manually by the programming through compiler options.

  Basically, the flow goes: you turn NetKAT into an FDD, then an FDD into a Flow Table.
  See paper "A Fast Compiler for NetKAT" (http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/papers/netkat-compiler.pdf)
  for details and theory behind it.  FDD's are nice because you can operate on them
  using the full well-established theory of BDD's.

module Field : sig

  (** Fields are analogous to binary variables in a BDD.
   These are pretty much the same as matchable fields in OpenFlow.  To this list, we
   add VSwitch, VPort and VFabric for the virtual compiler.  These are not actual matchable
   fields in OpenFlow, but are converted to Switch and Port in the compilation process.

   The constructors in type t are listed in the default order, which is acceptable for many
   NetKAT programs.

   This module implements the the [HashCmp] signature from the Vlr package, so it
   becomes the "V" in VLR. *)

module Value : sig

  (** In a BDD, each node is an implicit predicate, "variable = true".  In a FDD, each node is a test of a
  field against a particular value, as in EthSrc = "FE:89:00:12:34:12".  The edges are either true or false
  just like in a BDD.  But we also use values in modifcations - as in "port := 2".  Note only Const and Mask
  are really used by OpenFlow.  Both  Pipe and Query are translated to the pseudoport Controller.

   Each packet field can take on a certain range of values that in general have a lattice structure.
   This sometimes enables multiple tests on fields to be compressed into a single test. This module implements the [Lattice]
   signature from Vlr.

   All integer bit widths are represented by an
      [Int64.t] and will be cast to the appropriate bit width for use during
      final translation to flowtables.

      A simple bitmask variant is also supported. [Mask(n, m)] indicates that
      the first [m] bits of the value [n] are fixed, while the rest should be
      treated as wildcards.

      Because this is a big union of possible value types, it's possible for the
      programmer to construct [(Field.t, Value.t)] pairs that do not make any
      sense, e.g., [(Field.EthSrc, Value.Pipe "learn")]. This will be detected
      during flowtable generation, though the syntax of the NetKAT language will
      prevent programs from generating these ill-formed predicates.  *)
