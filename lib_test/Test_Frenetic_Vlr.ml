(* There's very little guidance on how to test Functors in isolation.  The Pa_ounit documentation says
   to place the tests inside the functor itself.  Then the tests are executed when you test concrete modules,
   but I don't really care for that.  It blends tests into production code, bloating the executable, etc.

   I decided to make easy types that fit the signatures, and test the module I get from passing those
   to the functor *)
