# Compiler Performance Benchmarks

This directory contains a number of performance benchmarks to test the
(local, global, and virtual) NetKAT compiler.
The compiler and the benchmarks are descriped in the following paper:

__A Fast Compiler for NetKAT__. Steffen Smolka, Spiridon Eliopoulos, Nate Foster, and Arjun Guha. In ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP), Vancouver, BC, September 2015. 


## Running the Benchmarks

Every directory contains a Makefile that can be used to __build & run__ the
respective benchmarks.
