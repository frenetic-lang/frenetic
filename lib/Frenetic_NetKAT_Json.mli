(** JSON serialization/deserialization of NetKAT messages.  

  NetKAT comes in two syntaxes: "regular" which is handled by Frenetic_NetKAT_Parser/Lexer
  and "json" which is handled here.  We translate most things to the Frenetic_NetKAT.policy
  type

  This module also serializes/deserializes switch-to-controller OpenFlow messages for net apps.
  TODO: These functions should be moved to Frenetic_NetKAT_SDN_Json, or should be consolidated
  here.  There's no good reason to differentiate between switch-to-controller and 
  controller-to-switch OpenFlow messages.  The only problem is this module can't open 
  Frenetic_OpenFlow due to collisions in some data types ... that'll need to be solved.
