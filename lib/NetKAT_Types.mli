(** {2 Headers} 

    We use the same packet headers that OpenFlow 1.0 supports. Refer to the
    OpenFlow specification for details on their semantics.

    The size of a header depends on the header name. But, insteam encoding this
    dependency in the type system, we place integers of various sizes in the
    [header_val] sum type.

    {b Warning:} Some header combinations are invalid and some headers
    depend on the presence of other headers. To be safe, use {i valid patterns}.

(** {2 Packets} 

    If we only defined the semantics and were not building a system, a
    packet would only be a record of headers. However, the runtime needs to
    apply [eval] to packets contained in [PACKET_IN] mesages. For the runtime,
    packets also carry a payload that is unmodified by [eval].

module HeaderMap : Map.S
  with type key = header

type header_val_map = header_val HeaderMap.t

type packet = {
  headers : header_val_map;
  (** Evaluating the policy [Test (h, v)] looks for [h] in these headers. If
      they are not found, we signal an error. An OpenFlow switch will never
      look for a header that does not exist. So, it is safe to assume that
       unused headers are set to zero or some other default value. *)
  payload : SDN_Types.payload
}

(** {2 Semantics}

    [eval pkt pol] raises [Not_found] if it tests or updates a header that  [pkt]
    does not have. This behavior is different from OpenFlow, which fails  silently
    in both cases.
