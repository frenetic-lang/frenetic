Documentation
-------------

We have developed several guides for getting up to speed on programming
OpenFlow networks in general and using Frenetic in particular. See the
[Frenetic Tutorial][tutorial] launch page for more details.

While the Frenetic language is primarily documented in the tutorial, the
[Frenetic Manual][manual] provides a lightweight reference for the Frenetic
DSL. The [API documentation][documentation] is also available online.
