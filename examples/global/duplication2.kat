(* The policy is a union of two subpolicies. Note how the second
   subpolicy is a strict subset of the first subpolicy.
   Hence, the second subpolicy should be optimized away by the compiler.
   Only a single packet should be send from switch 1 to switch 2 in all
   cases.

   Topology:  -----1-- S1 --2-----2-- S2 --1-------
