(* The barbell-topology example from the ICFP paper.

   Two classes of packets enter switch 3:
   * Packets originiating from port 1 at switch 1.
     These need to be forwarded out through port 1.
   * Packets originiatong from port 2 at switch 1.
     These need to be forwarded out through port 2.

  In order for switch 3 to be able to differentiate the two
  classes of packets, the compiler must insert tags at switch 1.

filter switch=1;(
  filter port=1; port:=3; 1@3=>3@3; port:=1 |
  filter port=2; port:=3; 1@3=>3@3; port:=2
