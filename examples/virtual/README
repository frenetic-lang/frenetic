VIRTUAL COMPILER EXAMPLES
=====================================================

Each folder comes with a script "run.sh". Execute it to compile the respective example.

You may have to install frenetic first by executing

   make && sudo make (re)install

in the frenetic root directory.

-----------------------------------------------------

For more options, like dumping the compiler's intermediate representation,
execute 

   frenetic dump virtual -help
